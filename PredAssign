##Read the Data

pml_train <- read.csv("C:/Users/chbasu/Downloads/pml-training.csv")
pml_test <- read.csv("C:/Users/chbasu/Downloads/pml-testing.csv")

##Exploratory Analysis

summary(pml_train)
summary(pml_test)
dim(pml_train)
dim(pml_test)

##There are 160 variables, I will have to reduce this count as there may not be so many  ##factors for prediction and also the model will run out of memory. After looking at the data  ##from above commands it is very evident that there are many missing values and various  ##variables with 0 variance.
##Removing the blank values and reducing the variables count which are of no use.

pml_train <- pml_train[, colSums(is.na(pml_train)) == 0]
pml_test <- pml_test[, colSums(is.na(pml_test)) == 0]

##Removing columns with timestamp, window etc.

pml_trainR <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(pml_train)) 

##Getting classe variable for temp
classe<- pml_train$classe


pml_train <- pml_train[, !pml_trainR]

## Removing non numeric columns
pml_trainM <- pml_train[, sapply(pml_train, is.numeric)]

##Attach classe column back so we can train the model.
pml_trainM$classe <- classe

##Training the model
library(caret)

RF <- train(classe ~ ., data=pml_trainM, method="rf")

Random Forest 

19622 samples
   52 predictor
    5 classes: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' 

No pre-processing
Resampling: Bootstrapped (25 reps) 
Summary of sample sizes: 19622, 19622, 19622, 19622, 19622, 19622, ... 
Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  mtry  Accuracy   Kappa    
   2    0.9930396  0.9911930
  27    0.9926730  0.9907290
  52    0.9842183  0.9800308

Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
The final value used for the model was mtry = 2. 

##Model is fit, we can predict now with test after cleaning the test data.

pml_testR <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(pml_test))
pml_test <- pml_test[, !pml_testR]
pml_testM <- pml_test[, sapply(pml_test, is.numeric)]

## Lets start our prediction
predict_RF <- predict(RF, pml_testM)
